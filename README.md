## General Information
- This Project is specific and limited to Data Analysis & Prediction using Linear Regression Algorithm on the given Data set.
- The Project is meant to understand each attributes in the given dataset which can be helpful in predicting demand for shared bikes.
- Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
- The data given to us contains the information about Bike sharing data points of past 2 years- 2018 and 2019.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We observed, Bike Sharing count is lowest in season of “spring”, increases modrately in summer, increase to highest  during fall and then dip during winter.
- Weathersit is having the most significant pattern to observe. The Bike sharing is at peak when the sky is clear or with less cloud. There is a significant dip in Bike sharing observed if the day is Cloudy & Misty.  There is further more dip in Bike sharing if during Light Snow and Rain.  And then the Least during Heavy rain and Snow.  Hence the weather plays a very significant role in Bike sharing business.
- We observed, there is significant increase in Bike Sharing count from 2018 to 2019. Hence every year there will be an increasing trend as per the data. But we can not confirm on this with only 2 years data.
- we observed there is no significant diffference between the Bike Sharing count during Working-day and Non-Workingday
